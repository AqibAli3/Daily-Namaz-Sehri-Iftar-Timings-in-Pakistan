# Daily Namaz Timings in Pakistan
This is a Streamlit app that provides daily Namaz timings for various cities in Pakistan. The app allows users to select a city and view prayer times according to both Hanafi and Jafri calculation methods.

To run this app locally, you need to have Python installed. First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Finally, run the app with the command streamlit run timing_app.py. The app will open in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:8501.

Once the app is running, you can use it by selecting a city from the dropdown menu and clicking the "Get Namaz Timings" button. The app will display the Namaz timings for the selected city, including Sehri and Iftar times for both Hanafi and Jafri methods. It will also show the next day's Sehri timings for both methods.

This app uses the Aladhan API to fetch Namaz timings. More information about the API can be found on their website.
